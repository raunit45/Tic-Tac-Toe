# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic tac toe game made with HTML , CSS and Java Script.
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This is a classic implementation of the popular two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is simple: be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features
Two-Player Mode: Play with a friend in a local two-player mode.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design making it easy for anyone to play.
Interactive Gameplay: Click on the cells to make your move.
Win Detection: Automatically checks for win conditions and declares the winner.

How to Play
The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move by clicking on an empty cell in the 3x3 grid.
Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks (X or O).
The game continues until one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or all cells are filled resulting in a draw.
The game will display a message announcing the winner or declaring a draw.
To play again, simply refresh the page or click the reset button (if available).
